# {{RECIPE_TITLE}}

## Purpose

Implement the exact authorized Angular client slice using its applied Web book,
current runtime sources and screen/workflow contract. Retained Next.js source is
reference evidence, not the framework or UI structure to generate for Angular.

## Required structure and ownership

- Keep the strict standalone Angular application under web-angular. No Next,
  React or mobile runtime imports; no BFF or JavaScript credential persistence.
- Use the chosen public platform/shared APIs. Use HttpClient only in data services,
  typed contracts and runtime validation at untrusted boundaries.
- Keep small local state in signals. Follow the approved D06 decision for larger
  state; do not invent a universal store/query engine.
- Use existing shared controls before adding visual wrappers. Where business UI is
  Excluded, do not create speculative forms, lists, module shells or routing.
- Preserve API scope, permissions, catalog keys, revision/conflict and lifecycle
  authority. API/native source changes need their own authorized scope.
- Register only existing source/config/test/evidence files in the final manifest.

## Runtime and translation checks

- [ ] Scope transition/logout clears old state before the next context is exposed.
- [ ] Cancellation and generation checks reject stale reads and late failures.
- [ ] Existing database-backed translation keys/catalog and company/system
      authority are preserved; shipped resources remain the fallback.
- [ ] Lazy namespace registration preserves accepted overrides and placeholders.
- [ ] Explicit user language wins over company default, with document lang/dir.
- [ ] Typed write/reset/default services preserve expectedRevision and surface
      conflicts without blind retry or forced overwrite.
- [ ] Service fixtures are distinguished from actual signed-in API/SQL/UI proof.
      Register later consumer/release acceptance in canonical central notes.
- [ ] Shared visual, form, grid, accessibility and view acceptance is exercised
      only for Required implemented surfaces under the current screen contract.

## Verification and handoff

Run focused behavioral tests plus strict type/template checks, architecture and
catalog checks and production build. Preserve bundle budgets. Record exact results,
scope exclusions and intentional retained-client differences in the applied book.
Regenerate feature-scoped packets; Phase 06 must be Verified before education.
