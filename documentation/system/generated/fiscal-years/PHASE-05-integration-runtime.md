# Fiscal Years Phase 05 - Integration and Runtime

## Purpose

Prove the feature is connected to the running system, not merely implemented in isolated files.

## Integration matrix

Verify all applicable registrations:

- API endpoint versioning, authentication, tenant membership, permissions, dependency injection, validation scan, mapping scan, database context, localization, Hangfire, notification, and realtime.
- Web route, API proxy path, endpoint registry, route access, navigation, permissions, query keys, realtime query registry, translations, report route, and import dependencies.
- Mobile route file, typed route constant, route manifest, navigation, permissions, endpoint client, query keys, realtime registry, notification deep-link mapping, translations, report file handling, and device-safe layout.

## Runtime evidence

- [ ] API request and response samples match documented field names and paging metadata.
- [ ] Browser and mobile requests serialize the same shared filters and sort tokens.
- [ ] Every Required Import client sends the documented exact request body and
      resolves dependency lookups through an authorized registered endpoint.
- [ ] Import success uses the documented plural audit/notification/realtime action
      and refreshes normal feature caches; conflict and network paths remain retryable as specified.
- [ ] A successful mutation refreshes all open clients through their normal cache/realtime path.
- [ ] Notification action URLs land on authorized routes in both clients.
- [ ] Unauthorized, read-only, validation, not-found, conflict, and network failures render safely.
- [ ] Production build configuration does not rely on local-only URLs or secrets.
- [ ] Localization and RTL are tested in actual runtime layouts.

Capture configuration and registration evidence separately from behavior tests.
A file existing in the feature folder does not prove its route, DI, permission,
realtime, notification, localization, report, or Import integration is reachable.
