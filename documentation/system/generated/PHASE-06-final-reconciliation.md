# Phase 06 - Final Reconciliation

## Purpose

Close the evidence loop and decide whether the feature is ready for handoff.

## Reconciliation gates

- [ ] Every requirement maps to implementation evidence and a verification result.
- [ ] Required-source manifest validation passes.
- [ ] No draft manifest, placeholder path, reference-only fingerprint, or shared output path is registered as final evidence.
- [ ] Generated documentation is current.
- [ ] API contract tests and focused feature tests pass.
- [ ] Web typecheck, lint, architecture checks, focused tests, and production build pass.
- [ ] Mobile typecheck, lint, architecture checks, focused tests, and supported platform checks pass.
- [ ] Desktop, compact browser, phone, tablet, English, Arabic, LTR, RTL, keyboard, and touch behavior are reviewed where applicable.
- [ ] Search, filter, sorting, pagination, refresh, mode switches, selection, forms, archive, restore, bulk, report, import, notification, and realtime paths are reconciled.
- [ ] Intentional API/web/mobile differences are documented.
- [ ] Open findings have severity, evidence, owner, and a release decision.
- [ ] No reference-specific field, ownership rule, view, or known gap was copied without a feature requirement.
- [ ] The chosen applied reference and every intentional departure from it are recorded.

## Handoff decision

Record one outcome: `Ready`, `Ready with accepted findings`, or `Not ready`. Include the exact commands run, dates, failed or skipped gates, and the responsible owner.
